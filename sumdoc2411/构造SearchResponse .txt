实现函数    public static SearchResponse createSearchResponse(SearchHit[] searchHits)


用到的代码如下



    public SearchResponse(SearchResponseSections internalResponse, String scrollId, int totalShards, int successfulShards,
                          int skippedShards, long tookInMillis, ShardSearchFailure[] shardFailures, Clusters clusters) {
        this.internalResponse = internalResponse;
        this.scrollId = scrollId;
        this.clusters = clusters;
        this.totalShards = totalShards;
        this.successfulShards = successfulShards;
        this.skippedShards = skippedShards;
        this.tookInMillis = tookInMillis;
        this.shardFailures = shardFailures;
        assert skippedShards <= totalShards : "skipped: " + skippedShards + " total: " + totalShards;
    }


public class SearchResponseSections implements ToXContentFragment {

    protected final SearchHits hits;
	
	    public SearchResponseSections(SearchHits hits, Aggregations aggregations, Suggest suggest, boolean timedOut, Boolean terminatedEarly,
                                  SearchProfileShardResults profileResults,  int numReducePhases) {
        this.hits = hits;
        this.aggregations = aggregations;
        this.suggest = suggest;
        this.profileResults = profileResults;
        this.timedOut = timedOut;
        this.terminatedEarly = terminatedEarly;
        this.numReducePhases = numReducePhases;
    }
	
	
	
	
	
	public final class SearchHits implements Streamable, ToXContentFragment, Iterable<SearchHit> {

    public static SearchHits empty() {
        // We shouldn't use static final instance, since that could directly be returned by native transport clients
        return new SearchHits(EMPTY, 0, 0);
    }

    public static final SearchHit[] EMPTY = new SearchHit[0];

    private SearchHit[] hits;
